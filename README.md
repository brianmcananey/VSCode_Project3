## Strategy

### THE 5 PLANES

- **Purpose of the website?**

    Provide a diverse and unbiased collections of restuarant reviews to help people decide where to go.

- **Target audience?**

    * Food Enthusiasts: Those who enjoy eating in a range of different restuarants and environments.

    * Tourists: those unfamiliar with the area looking for places to eat and drink.

- **Value to the user?**

    * Recommendations: each user to encouraged to provide honest feedback to help with recommendations.

    * Community and Connection: Helps connect like-minded individuals, share their experiences, and exchange ideas for places to visit.

- **What makes a good experience ?**

    * User-Friendly Interface: A well-designed and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, ensuring that users can find and upload reviews.

    * Responsive Design: A website that adapts seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience whether users are on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

    * Accessibility: Ensuring that the website is accessible to users with disabilities, including features like alt text for images and keyboard navigation.


- **What we shouldn't do?**

    * Spam or Over-Promotion: We do not engage in spammy practices, including excessive advertising, unsolicited emails, or intrusive pop-ups that disrupt the user experience.

    * Plagiarism: We do not plagiarize content from other sources. All content on our platform is original, properly attributed, and respects copyright laws.

    * Neglecting User Privacy: We do not compromise user privacy by sharing or selling personal information without consent. We adhere to strict privacy policies to protect user data.

### The Why

To help restuarants in the area gain more custom, to provide users with a place to read honest reviews, and to help them with their choices.

### The Business Goal

- Expand our user base to build a thriving community.

- Gain revenue streams through advertising.

- Encourage more custom to the area.

## UX
### Color Scheme

- here are the colors chosen, I believe they have a good contrast to the hero image and background colors.

### Typography

I have chose the "sans-serif" font as I believe it suits the layout of the website and simple style the website is going for. The back-up font is Times New Roman.

### Imagery

* Imagery is very important to the website as the site needs to show off the area the restaurants are in and be appealing for people to come and visit.

* The pages will be consistent with the same large hero image displayed over the contents of the pages. They will also have the same navbar and footer.

### Icons

* I used icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to click on certain buttons and to add a clear visual indicator of where to click.

## Structure

### Information Architecture

* I used a similar layout to the Thorin and Company example in the Code Institute course as I believed it would suit the layout of my hero image and website as a whole. The website has a Homepage, then 4 further pages; a About page, a Sign Up page, Log in page and a Contact page. It will also have a logout function.
  - Homepage - Large hero image showing a view of the area. It will also show a selection of customer reviews.
  - About Page - This will show images and descriptions of different restuarants in the area.
  - Sign Up - Same large hero image as the homepage but will also have a form on to sign up to the site.
  - Log in - Same large hero image as the homepage but will also have a form on to log in to the site.
  - Contact - Same large hero image as the homepage but will also have a contact/review form to complete to provide your feedback.

## User Stories

- **Log In and Sign Up**
    - I added a Sign up Feature so users can provide their own feedback.

    - Users that are Signed Up and Logged in can leave a review.



- **About Page**
    - The About page provides a list of different restuarants you could visit in the area, these could be added to in future and maybe provide direct links to each individual business.



## **DATABASES**
In this application, I rely on [MySQL](https://mysql.com/) as the primary database management system. MySQL is an open sourced database that allows us to store and manage data in a format that seamlessly fits the dynamic nature of our project. It plays a crucial role in storing user information, reviews and other essential data.


### CRUD Functionality

- **User Management:**
1. **Create User (C):**
   - Description: Allows users to register by providing necessary information. Includes checks for:
     - Matching passwords
     - Existing username

    - HTTP Method: POST

    - Database Operation: Inserts new user document into the "users" collection.

2. **Read User (R):**
    - Function: 'autheticate_user'

    - Description: Authenticates a user based on their username and password.

    - HTTP Method: N/A(Called within the sign_in route)

    - Database Operation: Reads user information to verify credentials.


2. **Sign In (R):**
    - Function: 'sign_in'

    - Description: Allows users to sign in by providing their credentials. Includes checks for:
        - Incorrect username or password

    - HTTP Method: GET and POST

    - Database Operation: Calls authenticate_user to validate user credentials.

3. **Log Out:**
    - Description: Allows users to log out of their accounts.

    - HTTP Method: GET

    - Database Operation: N/A 

    The log out function works by removing the users session cookie (session.clear).

### Deployment with Heroku

This application can be deployed on Heroku to make it accessible on the web. Follow these steps to deploy your app:

#### Prerequisites

Before deploying the app on Heroku, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Heroku Account](https://signup.heroku.com/) - You need a Heroku account to deploy your app.
2. [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) - Install the Heroku Command Line Interface to interact with Heroku from your terminal.

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Login to Heroku**: Open your terminal and log in to your Heroku account using the following command:
   
    ```
    heroku login
    ```
    Follow the prompts to log in to your Heroku account.

2. **Create a Heroku App**: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and create a new Heroku app
    ```
    heroku create your-app-name
    ```
    Replace your-app-name with a unique name for your app. Heroku will provide you with a URL for your app (e.g., https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/).

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like secret keys and API credentials as environment variables on Heroku. You can set these variables using the Heroku CLI or through the Heroku Dashboard
    ```
    heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    heroku config:set API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
    Replace your-secret-key and your-api-key with the actual values you need to configure.

4. **Deploy to Heroku**: Deploy your app to Heroku by pushing your code to the Heroku remote repository
    ```
    git push heroku main
    ```
    Ensure that you have committed all your changes to the main branch before running this command.

5. **Open the App**: Once the deployment is complete, you can open your app in your web browser using the following command.
    ```
    heroku open
    ```
    This will open your app in a new browser window.

### Local vs Deployment

When working with this project, it's important to understand the differences between running the application locally and deploying it to Heroku:

- **Local Development**: Running the application locally is ideal for development and testing purposes. You can make changes, test new features, and experiment with the code in a controlled environment.

- **Heroku Deployment**: Deploying the application to Heroku makes it accessible to a wider audience on the web. It's suitable for sharing your project with others and providing a public URL for access.

Choose the deployment option that best suits your needs and project goals.

Always follow the steps and ensure that your sensitive information(API Keys, Database credentials, etc) are not visible to the public.
